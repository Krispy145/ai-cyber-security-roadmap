# AI + Cybersecurity Roadmap

Public tracker of my transition into **AI Engineering with a Cybersecurity foundation**.  
This roadmap outlines my learning, certifications, and project milestones — all of which are reflected live on my portfolio site.

This repository also powers my **live Flutter CV**, where each milestone and repository card is dynamically rendered from the manifest below.
